# Docker Compose environment example (not Laravel .env)
# This file is used by Docker Compose to set environment variables for services.
# For production with Caddy auto-HTTPS, you must set APP_DOMAIN (and optionally APP_DOMAIN_WWW).
# In development:
# - When you run make from the project root, Compose loads the root .env (not this file).
# In production:
# - deploy.sh runs from docker/, so Compose reads docker/.env. Copy this file to docker/.env on the server and fill in values.

# App / Global
APP_NAME=laravel-app
TZ=UTC

# Caddy hostnames (production, required)
# TODO: Replace with your real domains before deploying to production.
# These are read by the caddy service and used in docker/Caddyfile.
APP_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
# Optional: set a www host or remove it from Caddyfile if unused
APP_DOMAIN_WWW=www.your-domain.com

# Database (internal Docker network hostnames)
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Queue
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis

# Cache
CACHE_DRIVER=redis

# Session
SESSION_DRIVER=redis

# Redis (internal Docker network hostname)
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
