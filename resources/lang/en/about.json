Here you will find articles that are not afraid to pose bold theses, as well as texts with one main feature – to inspire.\n\n###A Space for Thoughts, Questions, and Inspiration\n\nOur core belief is that no text is a final, indisputable monologue. We treat them rather as the beginning of a conversation. Even the most thoughtful article can become an inspiration for you to challenge one of its theses – and that's a good thing! We are open to such dialogue and believe that through critique, we can all broaden our horizons.\n\n###Your Voice in Our Community\n\nWe value every constructive opinion. Although the direct ability to comment posts is currently in the works, we already encourage you to share your thoughts, especially critical ones, via our email address. If you give us your consent, we will be happy to publish your comment under the respective article, making it a lively and multifaceted one."
